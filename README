Fortran-F90Format version 0.40
==============================


F90Format implements basic I/O formating, based on 
the Digital FORTRAN 90 I/O formatting specifications (April 1997).
F90Format provides a consistent way of reading and writing fixed
length fields in tabular data, by using the same syntax for reading
and writing. The same task in Perl requires synchronizing the format
strings in sprintf and pack/unpack functions.
Although this is possible, sprintf sometimes exceeds the length of the
desired field. This 'feature' of sprintf combined with the fact that
pack/unpack never go beyond the desired field width may eventually result
in data corruption.
